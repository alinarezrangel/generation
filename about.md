Generation is a powerful CSS3 & HTML5 framework which makes use of modern web
technologies to create beutiful responsive web pages and applications without
writting lots of boilerplate CSS. Generation have three (3) main libraries:

1. The elements library: This provides the basic elements for the page/app,
like modals, containers, lists, grids, dropdowns and others. For example,
the `.container` class creates a container element.
2. The utility library: This provides classes that only change the aspect of
any element. For example, the `.no-padding` class removes any padding on the
element and the `.font-size-mega` sets the font size to a really big value
(perfect for titles).
3. The color library: This defines a set of colors grouped on
*Color Palletes*, these paletes are easy to create, modify and use.

One of the main goals of Generation is to provide a powerful framework in
which the CSS written is minimal.
