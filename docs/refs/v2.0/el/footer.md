```scss
/* Footer Class Specialization */

footer.container {...} /* From 2.0.0 */
.footer {...}          /* From 2.0.0 */
```

The `.footer` class specialization provides a useful way to style the footers
of a page.

This class inherits the `.container` class.

The `.footer` class shows as a `.container` with no margin and with the
**double** of padding.
