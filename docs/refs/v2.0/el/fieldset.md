```scss
/* FieldSet Class */

.fieldset {...} /* From 2.0.0 */
```

The `.fieldset` class specialization was designed to add semantic value to any
container of related HTML inputs. You can use this class on both HTML fieldsets
(the `<fieldset>` element) or dynamic JavaScript fieldsets (just a container
with some related `<input>` elements inside). This class has a big semantic
value.

This class inherits the `.box` class.

This class just adds some padding and margin.
